### 20/05/2024

Worked on flow and database design

Flow Version 1:
![Design Flow V.1](images/flow1.png)

Problem I'm facing is to figure out how admin portal will work.
Also how the students can cancel without the risk of getting impersonated.

Database Version 1:
![Design Dababase V.1](images/db1.png)
There's 2 and tables and 1 linking table to get data of signed up students. Have to check if the information of the student and event table are enough or too much.

I will need to get feedback from my end-user about both the flow and the DB.

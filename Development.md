### 20/05/2024

Worked on flow and database design

Flow Version 1:
![Design Flow V.1](images/flow1.png)

Problem I'm facing is to figure out how admin portal will work.
Also I have to figure out how the students can cancel/undo sign-ups without the risk of getting impersonated. I'm thinking of making the student enter their school password when they signed-up and undo but not sure if that's a good idea or not.

Database Version 1:
![Design Database V.1](images/db1.png)
There's 2 and tables and 1 linking table to get data of signed up students. Have to check if the information of the student and event table are enough or too much.

I will need to get feedback from my end-user about both the flow and the DB. I also have to ask them of their preferred color pallete.

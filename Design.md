Project Name: **International Events Register System**

Project Author: **Jess Lerch**

## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

The client I am working with in this project is the International Department. This project is aim to reduce the inconvenient that the international department faced when organizing extra curricular events. Sometimes the students handwriting are hard to read and identify who is signed up, and who are coming. With this project I want to give the international staffs and leaders an easier time planning and organizing events.

### End-User Requirements

This will work as a multi-user system:

- **The International Leaders/Staffs** are involved in organizing events. In order to efficiently planned the equipment needed they would need to be able to clearly see a list of the students that are coming.

- **The International Students**

Replace this text with a description of your typical end-users and their specific needs / expectations / requirements.

### Proposed Solution
